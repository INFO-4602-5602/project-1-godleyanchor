Whistle: Replication:
	I replicated each of the scatterplots using Tableau rather than the d3 tools. The method that I 
	used to make these images was to drag the measure label icon from the dimensions over to the 
	column and row fields. I then put the attributes for the x and y data after them and plotted them
	in a scatterplot as a dimension rather than a sum. Tableau is no the most intuitive interface,
	but as predominately a C and Python programmer, I'm not the biggest fan of d3 and javascript so
	these were actually easier to make as opposed to similar images made in Python.
